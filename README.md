# Multidiscrete Gym Environment with PPO PyTorch Framework
This project involves testing a Multidiscrete Gym environment using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm implemented in PyTorch. The Multidiscrete environment represents an environment where the action space consists of multiple discrete action spaces. PPO is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and effectiveness in continuous control tasks.
