# Multidiscrete Gym Environment with PPO PyTorch Framework
This project involves testing a Multidiscrete Gym environment using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm implemented in PyTorch. The Multidiscrete environment represents an environment where the action space consists of multiple discrete action spaces. PPO is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm known for its stability and effectiveness in continuous control tasks.

# Usage
Run Training Script: Execute the training script to start training the PPO agent in the Multidiscrete environment.

$ python Train.py

#Note
While we use the snake env in this testing, the framework is designed to be compatible with various custome environment created with MultiDiscrete OpenAi Gym.
